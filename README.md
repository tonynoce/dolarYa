# The problem
Dollar price in Argentina is a problem and foreigners don't understand that there is an """"official"""" rate and a " blue " rate which everyone uses.

To solve this problem, this small app will get the price from a trusty oracle and then provide the interface to the user to exchange from ARS to USD or viceversa.

<br/>

# Price Feed
The price gets feeded from Yadio API via a request. <br/>
Yadio uses the feed of several crypto P2P, this is a better representation of the fluctuations in price than dolar blue, since it correspond to the movement of the retail trading.

# The project
Is fully functional and performs as expected. Even some erroe-handling.
