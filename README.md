# Disclaimer
This is my first app ! I'm learning python so every feedback is welcome ! :)

# dolarYa
PythonApp to get the price of the dollar and perform convertions to ARS

<br/>

# The problem
Dollar price in Argentina is a problem and foreigners don't understand that there is an """"official"""" rate and a " blue " rate which everyone uses.

To solve this problem, this small app will get the price from a trusty oracle and then provide the interface to the user to exchange from ARS to USD or viceversa.

<br/>

# Price Feed
The price gets feeded from Yadio API via a request. <br/>
Yadio uses some of the same " blue dollar " exchanges in Argentina so it's mostly accuarate.

# The project

It's on an early stage, still have to figure out how to handle errors and connection errors so the app doesnt crash, but the main functionality is there.
