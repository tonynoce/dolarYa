PythonApp to get the price of the dollar and perform convertions to ARS

# The problem
Dollar price in Argentina is a problem and foreigners don't understand that there is an official rate and a " blue " rate which everyone uses.

To solve this problem, this small app will get the price from a trusty oracle and then provide the interface to the user to exchange from ARS to USD or viceversa.
